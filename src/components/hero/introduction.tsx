				I&apos;m a Moroccan Software Engineer who genuinely enjoys building
				stuff from the ground up. Full-stack work is my thing—whether I&apos;m
				setting up databases, writing APIs, or building the interface people
				actually see. I like the puzzle of making systems work well and scale
				properly. Here&apos;s the thing though: even with all the AI tools out
				there, I still grab pen and paper when I need to think through a
				problem. There&apos;s something about sketching things out that just
				works. And coffee? Non-negotiable. Good coffee makes tackling tough
				challenges way more enjoyable.
